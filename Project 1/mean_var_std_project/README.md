# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the first project of the freeCodeCamp "Data Analysis with Python" course.

## 📌 Project Goal

Build a function named `calculate()` that takes a list of 9 numbers and returns a dictionary with the mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum, calculated both row-wise, column-wise, and for the entire 3×3 matrix.

## 📁 Files Included

- `mean_var_std.py` → Main Python file with the `calculate()` function.

## 🧮 Example

```python
>>> calculate([2,6,2,8,4,0,1,5,7])


Returns/outputs:

{
  'mean': [[3.666..., 5.0, 3.333...], [3.333..., 4.0, 4.0], 3.888...],
  'variance': [...],
  'standard deviation': [...],
  'max': [...],
  'min': [...],
  'sum': [...]
}
