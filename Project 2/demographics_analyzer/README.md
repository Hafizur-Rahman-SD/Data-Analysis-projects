# 📊 Demographic Data Analyzer

This is **Project 2** of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification.  
In this project, I wrote a function that reads data from a CSV file and calculates different demographic statistics.

## 📁 Dataset Used
The project uses the **adult.data.csv** dataset which contains information about age, education, hours worked per week, income, etc.

## ✅ What This Project Does

The function `calculate_demographic_data()` does the following:

- Counts how many people belong to each race
- Calculates the average age of men
- Finds the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree
- Compares income between people with and without higher education
- Finds the minimum number of work hours per week
- Checks what percentage of people who work minimum hours earn more than 50K
- Finds which country has the highest percentage of rich people
- Finds the most common high-earning occupation in India
